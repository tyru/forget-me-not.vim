INTERFACE					*forgetmenot-interface*

COMMANDS					*forgetmenot-commands*
--------

						*:ForgetMeNot*
:ForgetMeNot [-help] {command} {args ...}

						*:ForgetMeNot-help*
:ForgetMeNot -help
:ForgetMeNot help
	Show this command's help.

						*:ForgetMeNot-recover*
:ForgetMeNot recover [-stale] [-silent] [{name}]
	Recover a previous session per vim instance, tab.
	Recording tab sessions are optional (disabled by default. To enable it,
	see |g:forgetmenot_enable_tab_session|).
	If {name} was given, recover the named session if it exists.
	TODO: -stale, -silent

						*:ForgetMeNot-save*
:ForgetMeNot save[!] {name}
	Save current session as {name}.
	This sets current session to {name}, and keep writing to the session
	every |g:forgetmenot_instance_session_interval| milliseconds.

						*:ForgetMeNot-write*
:ForgetMeNot write[!] {name}
	Write current session as {name}.
	This command is almost same as |:ForgetMeNot-save| but this doesn't
	set current session to {name}.
	Thus changes after running this command won't save to the specified
	named session.
	If [!] was not given and {name} exists, it failed.
	If [!] was given, overwrite the session.

VARIABLES					*forgetmenot-variables*
