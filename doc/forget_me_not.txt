==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*forgetmenot-interface*

COMMANDS					*forgetmenot-commands*
--------

						*:ForgetMeNot*
:ForgetMeNot [-help] {command} {args ...}

						*:ForgetMeNot-help*
:ForgetMeNot -help
:ForgetMeNot help
	Show this command's help.

						*:ForgetMeNot-recover*
:ForgetMeNot recover [-stale] [-unstale] [-named] [-silent] [{name}]
	Select and recover a previous session from vim instances, named
	sessions.
	If {name} was given, recover the named session and sets current
	session to {name} (this lets Vim keep updating the session each
	|g:forgetmenot_instance_session_interval|).

	-stale lists only stale sessions.
	-silent does not echo anything when there are no sessions to restore.

						*:ForgetMeNot-save*
:ForgetMeNot save[!] [{name}]
	Save current session as {name}.
	This works like |:save| for session file.
	This sets current session to {name}, and keep writing to the session
	every |g:forgetmenot_instance_session_interval| milliseconds.

						*:ForgetMeNot-write*
:ForgetMeNot write[!] [{name}]
	Write current session as {name}.
	This works like |:write| for session file.
	This command is almost same as |:ForgetMeNot-save| but this doesn't
	set current session to {name} when {name} was given.
	Thus changes after running this command won't save to the specified
	named session.
	If [!] was not given and {name} exists, it failed.
	If [!] was given, overwrite the session.
						*:ForgetMeNot-list*
:ForgetMeNot list [-stale] [-unstale] [-named]
	List sessions specified by options.
	If nothing was specified, list all sessions.

	-stale lists only stale sessions.
	-unstale lists only non-stale sessions.
	-named lists only named sessions.

VARIABLES					*forgetmenot-variables*

				*g:forgetmenot_instance_session_interval*
g:forgetmenot_instance_session_interval
			(default: `60 * 1000`)
	Save instance session each this interval.

				*g:forgetmenot_base_dir*
g:forgetmenot_base_dir
			(default: `'~/.local/cache/vim-forget-me-not'`)
	Base directory for this plugin.
	All files managed by this plugin are stored under this directory.

				*g:forgetmenot_named_session_options*
g:forgetmenot_named_session_options
			(default: `'blank,curdir,folds,help,localoptions,options,tabpages,terminal,winsize'`)
	|'sessionoptions'| value used by |:ForgetMeNot-write| and
	|:ForgetMeNot-save| commands

				*g:forgetmenot_list_datetime_format*
g:forgetmenot_list_datetime_format
			(default: `'%c'`)
	This value is used by |:ForgetMeNot-list| to show instance session's
	modification time.
	Same format as |strftime()|.
